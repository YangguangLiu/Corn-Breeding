# Corn-Breeding

Today, the agriculture industry works to maximize the amount of food we gain from crops by breeding
plants with the strongest, highest-yielding genetics. Plant breeding is complex, and data analytics can help
scientists at research and development organizations like Syngenta make progress in seed product development.

Commercial corn is processed into multiple food and industrial products. It is widely known as one of the
world’s most important crops. Each year, plant breeders create new corn products, known as experimental
hybrids, by crossing two “parents” together. The parents are known as inbreds and the development of the
inbreds takes up the bulk of a corn breeding program. Most of that effort is spent evaluating the inbreds by
crossing to another inbred, called a “tester.”

Given historical hybrid (inbred by tester) performance data across years and locations, how can we create a
model to predict the performance of the crossing of any two inbred and tester parents?
This project is to create a data driven model that predict the general performance of the crossing of any two
inbred and tester parents, so that breeder can make beteer decision on which hybrid should be provided to
grower for increasing productivity to meet the world’s growing demand.
